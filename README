The analysis made with 100000 particle IDs, populated in the five
data structures - Linked Lists, Hash with linear probing,
Hash with linked lists, binary search trees and AVL trees -
guaranteed us a detailed performance analysis of all structures
used, after the procedures for inserting and searching for IDs in the five
structures. We prove that the best data structure for searching for
IDs is Hash with Linked Lists, which guaranteed an optimal search due to
its collision treatment method, with an average of approximately 1.5
comparisons for each ID, a much smaller number compared to any
one of the other four structures.
